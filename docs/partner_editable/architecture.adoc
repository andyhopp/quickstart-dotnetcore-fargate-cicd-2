image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.
* In the private subnets:
** An Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) service using AWS Fargate to host the containers.
* An implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using AWS DevOps services:
** An AWS CodeCommit code repository to host application source code.
** An AWS CodePipeline build orchestration pipeline that automatically triggers a build process when changes are pushed to the code repository.
** A CodePipeline stage that performs the build process for a container image using AWS CodeBuild.
** A CodePipeline stage that deploys the updated application container image to the ECS service.
* AWS Identity and Access Management roles for the CI/CD pipeline's build and deployment process.

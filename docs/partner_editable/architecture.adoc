As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* An implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using the following AWS DevOps services:
** An AWS CodePipeline build orchestration pipeline that automatically triggers a build process when changes are pushed to the code repository.
** An AWS CodeCommit repository to host application source code.
** AWS CodeBuild to serve as a CodePipeline stage for performing the build process for a container image.
** Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) for deploying the updated application container image. 
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for storing CodePipeline artifacts.
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for the CI/CD pipeline's build and deployment process.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.
* In the private subnets:
** Fargate tasks to host the containers using Amazon ECS.
** An Application Load Balancer to direct traffic to the Fargate cluster.

This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for users who are interested in creating a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a .NET application in their AWS environment using AWS' portfolio of DevOps services. This Quick Start follows best practices to create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and deploys a .NET application to AWS Fargate. This Quick Start can be used as both a reference architecture as well as a template for creating a fully-implemented CI/CD pipeline for deployment of a .NET application to Fargate by uploading the application's source code to the code repository created by the Quick Start.
